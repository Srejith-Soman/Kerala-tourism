          <h5 class="card-title">THIRUVANANTHAPURAM</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Thiruvananthapuram, built on seven hills, has today growninto a sprawling metropolis; but thankfully the city still retains her past glory and charm, 
            and in spite of the frenetic pace of modern life, perhaps it is the most sedate of the big cities of the State. The people too have retained their friendliness and hospitality, 
            and communicating in English, Hindi or Tamil is as easy as it is in the native Malayalam, whether one is talking to a retired professor or to the man in the street. But be prepared
            for a ‘dose’ of highly individualistic observations though– a hallmark of the Malayali that has enabled him to adapt and to survive the Tsunamis of alien cultures and ideas, and all
             things ‘modern’. The old quarter of the city clusters in and around the East Fort, a protected landmark that dates back to the Royal days. The rightly famous Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple 
             , the Navarathri Mandapam, where the annual musical fest is held as an offering to Saraswati, the Goddess of Learning , Kuthira Malika, a uniquely wonderful example of traditional 
             architecture and the venue of the annual Swathi Thirunal music festival honouring the composer-king of Travancore are the best among the traditional structures that adorn the Fort enclave.
              The Mahatma Gandhi Road, the chief artery of the city, is lined by traditional mansions that proclaim the grandeur of the times past and modern high-rises that testify to the
               city’s newfound affluence and a brashly commercial taste –red tile and timber vying with concrete 
             and glass.

            What perhaps is special about the ambience of Thiruvananthapuram is the wonderful blend of the strongly traditional,the nostalgically Colonial and the outright modern elements, be it in architecture, in food or in the dress and manners of her people. 
             The city’s spirit of ‘live and let live’ is nowhere more evident than at Palayam (the Garrison, the seat of the old Cantonment), where threecentres of worships of three faiths rub shoulders–the ancient Ganapathy Temple (ostensibly built by the Maharajah
              for the prosperity of the Connemara Market nearby), the Palayam Muslim Mosque (get the correct name) and the Palayam Christian Cathedral (get the correct name) church with its distinctive Gothic tower. 
            Blessed with a pleasant climate virtually throughout the year, Thiruvananthapuram city sparkles after the monsoon rains. After the ‘hot’ summers, which thankfully pale in comparison to the ‘hotspots’ of India, the welcome summer showers augur the festival 
            season when Kerala decks herself out, and traditional colours and rhythms and characters straight from the pages of her ancient lore entice the visitor to another world. The festivities are crowned by Onam , the Spring harvest festival, today marked by traditional 
            fare throughout the State, including the spirited race of the picturesque and majestic snake boats , the grand elephant parade, when hordes of caparisoned pachyderms lend an air of fantasy to the setting, and the special presentations of Kathakali , Mohiniyattom ,
             Koodiyattom and other traditional arts of Kerala. etc</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Varkala</h5>
          <p class="card-text">  Varkala, a calm and quiet hamlet, lies on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram district. It has several tourist attractions that include a beautiful beach,
            a 2000-year-old Vishnu Temple and the Ashramam - Sivagiri Mutt a little distance from the beach. The Papanasam Beach (also called as Varkala Beach), which is ten kilometers away 
            from Varkala, is renowned for a natural spring. Which is considered to have medicinal and curative properties. A dip in the holy waters at this beach is believed to purge the body
             of impurities and the soul of all sins; hence the name 'Papanasam Beach'. A two thousand-year-old shrine the Janardhanaswamy Temple stands on the cliffs overlooking the beach, 
             a short distance away. The Sivagiri Mutt, founded by the great religious reformer and philosopher Sree Narayana Guru (1856 - 1928) is also close by The Samadhi 
             (the final resting place) of the Guru here attracts thousands of devotees every year during the Sivagiri Pilgrimage days - 30th December to 1st January. Sree Narayana Guru 
             propagated the ideology: "one caste, one religion and one God", in a society torn by the taboos of caste system.
